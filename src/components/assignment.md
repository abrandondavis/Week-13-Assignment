# LoginForm Component
Create a `LoginForm` component that includes the following elements:

- Username and password input fields.
- An `<h3>` element with the text "Log In" and a border.
- Style the component using the default generated CSS file.

# Navigation Component
Create a `Navigation` component that includes:

- Links styled like a navbar.
